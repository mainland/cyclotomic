The cyclotomic numbers are a subset of the complex numbers that are
represented exactly, enabling exact computations and equality
comparisons.  They contain the Gaussian rationals (complex numbers of
the form p + q i with p and q rational), as well as all complex roots
of unity.  The cyclotomic numbers contain the square roots of all
rational numbers.  They contain the sine and cosine of all rational
multiples of pi.  The cyclotomic numbers form a field, being closed
under addition, subtraction, mutiplication, and division.
